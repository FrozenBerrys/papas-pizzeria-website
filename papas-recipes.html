    <div>Roy hasn't learnt javascript yet so the customers can't order... but while they wait they can admire the mouthwatering recipes Papa's Pizzeria offers</div>
    

    <h2>Pepperoni</h2>
    <h3>$17.99</h3>
    <img src="images/pepperoni.png" alt="pepperoni" class="img">
    <p>Classic! Except there is a human number of pepperonis on this batch, <em>ahem Cooper</em></p>


    <h2>Meat Lover</h2>
    <h3>$19.99</h3>
    <img src="images/meatlover.png" alt="Meat Lover" class="img">
    <p>Too broke to buy beef from the farmers market? Don't worry, we've got you covered. These beef sausages don't 
        taste like organic beef, but your taste-buds will be so offended by the overcooked nature of the dough that it'll
        learn to appreciate the parts that aren't so overcooked. 
    </p>


    <h2>Veggie</h2>
    <h3>$15.99</h3>
    <img src="images/veggie-fried.png" alt="Veggie" class="img">
    <p>If you can't handle the meat, c'mon take a seat and try our award-winning veggie pizza, famous rapper 
    loved it so much she made a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC3ujDPBO8g&ab_channel=ashishio_" >viral hit</a> 
    dedicated to this delicious recipe that does vegan options justice. </p> 


    <h2>Old Soul</h2>
    <h3>$15.99</h3>
    <img src="images/old-soul.png" alt="Old Soul" class="img">
    <p>If you've worked at the Pizzeria for a summer job, you probably remember a funny fella named Wally...
        All part-timers deal with the existential dread of knowing there's a man out there who orders just 8 anchovies... 
        those 4 cuts feel like an eternity. We started scheming, every Monday at 8:45, his  pizza would be ready in the 
        oven with olive juice and bits of sausage plants on top. We did this for 3 months. The man was basically eating 
        an alpha version of the Old Soul at this point. He was the first to try it, and immediately died from a heart 
        attack. Which is where the name Old Soul comes from anyways. It's a great combination for the savory-inclined, 
        we recommend our customers to try it once to honor the old soul Wally. </p>


    <h2>Onion Rings</h2>
    <h3>$14.99</h3>
    <img src="images/onion rings.png" alt="Onion Rings" class="img">
    <p>Like live dolphin shows? How about a live dolphin show right on your plate? Mcdonald's onion rings are good, but
        are those densely packed empty calories really worth a sidepiece in this economy? We have a full two-in-one meal
        in this eccentric recipe, but we promise it doesn't taste as eccentric as it looks! Seriously! It tastes like nothing!
        Still beats Mcdonald's.
    </p>


    <h2>Variety</h2>
    <h3>$19.99</h3>
    <img src="images/variety.png" alt="Variety" class="img">
    <p>If you like fireworks, why not try making one... in your mouth? Look out! Fire or Choking Hazard?</p>


    <h2>Light Meal</h2>
    <h3>$14.99</h3>
    <img src="images/light-meal.png" alt="Light Meal" class="img">
    <p>If none of our previous recipes tickled your fancy, the next one sure won't. We get that our recipes can are not 
        for everyone, and this recipe is just perfect for customers who want to go easy on their digestive system.</p>


    <h2>I hate myself</h2>
    <h3>$21.99</h3>
    <img src="images/seance.png" alt="I hate myself" class="img">
    <p>We have no idea who allowed this, but at least they were nice enough to give the sausages a large radius.</p>
